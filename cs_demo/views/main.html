						<p> The node app was created as an exercise to learn nodejs. Creating an angular template with this app required a grasp on many aspects of nodejs, including but not limited to: nodejs structure, use of external files, dependent and parallel asynchronous calls, local file access, and many (many) node modules, such as: sandbox, Q, prompt, fs, exports, readline, jade, ncp, mkdirp and swig. and this does not include the several node modules that were installed then ripped out due to one issue or another. Having the function of this app create an angular template also had one other advantage, it helped me become reacquainted with angularjs. : ) </p>
						<p>You can fork the node app at <a href='https://github.com/bill209'>github - bill209</a>.</p>
						<p>Where's the value to you? Well, depending on your skill level, its value is either minimal or non-existent. If you are relatively new to angularjs, then this app will provide you with a custom angularjs template that largely follows the coding patterns as outlined by John Papa.<sup>1</sup> You can read more about his patterns in his <a href=''>Angular Styleguide</a>. </p>
